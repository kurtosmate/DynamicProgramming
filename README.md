# Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming based algorithms

I started to have fun with some Dynamic programming algorithms in C#. 
I'm going to implement most of the known solutions as my time allows.
Every folder contains a "Main.cs" which is the client of the actual algorithm. It demonstrates how to call and use them.

#1: Knapsack problem. I've created two solutions, one is matrix based for small amount of weights, the other one is B-tree based uses branch and bound approaches. This one is better for large weights

#2: Travelling salesman problem. I've created a matrix based solution.
