# Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming based algorithms

I started to have fun with some Dynamic programming algorithms in C#.

#1: Knapsack problem. I've created two solutions, one is matrix based for small amount of weights, the other one is B-tree based uses branch and bound approaches. This one is better for large weights
